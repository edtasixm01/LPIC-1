### Exercices


1. Which is the boot procc√©s order?
   ```
   POST, setup (Bios), Boostrap, Grub, Kernel, Systemd
   ```
   
2. What does POST mind?
   ```
   Power on self test
   ```
   
3. On a machine equipped with a BIOS firmware, where is the bootstrap binary located?
   ```
   MBR Master Boot Record
   ```

4. On a machine equipped with a UEFI firmware, where is the bootstrap binary located?
   ```
   EFI partition
   /boot/efi
   ```

5. Which is the most common bootloader used on machines?
   ```
   GRUB
   ```

6. Enumerate three kernel options
   ```
   root ro rw quiet 1..5(runlevel) systemd quiet
   ```

7. Suppose the system is unable to boot due to a misinformed root filesystem location. How would the correct root filesystem, located at /dev/sda3, be given as a parameter
to the kernel?
   ```
   root=/dev/device
   ```

8. Which kernel option would suppress the boot hardware console messages?
   ```
   quiet
   ```

9. What is an initramfs file?
   ```
   Initial RAM disk, contains initial software
   ```

10. Where are the initramfs and the kernel files? Can there be more than one?
    ```
    /boot
    ```

11. Write the name of one kernel file and describe its parts.
    ```
    vmlinuz-5.11.11-100.fc32.x86_64
    release
    version
    architecture
    ```

12. Which is the first process of the operating system? Which is its PID? How can we show that information?
    ```
    systemd (1)
    init (1)
    ```

13. Enumerate three distinct implementations of system initiators
    ```
    SystemV init
    systemd
    upstart
    ```

14. What dmesg option will automatically paginate its output, eliminating the need to use a pager command explicitly?
    ```
    dmesg --human
    ```

15. Where are the kernel messages stored?
    ```
    In the kernel ring buffer, the dmesg command show them
    ```

16. How can be shown the messages of the previous (before the actual) boot?
    ```
    journalctl -b -1
    ```

17. How can the last boots of the system be listed?
    ```
    journalctl --list-boots
    ```
