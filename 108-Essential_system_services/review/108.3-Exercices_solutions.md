## 108.3 Mail Transfer Agent MTA basics

### Exercices

1. Install and start the sendmail service
   ```
   sudo apt-get install sendmail

   ```

2. Send two messages to another user (not to root, user1 to user2).
   ```
   mail user-destination
   mail -s “subject message” user-destination 

   ```

3. As the other user check the messages, delete the first one and answer the second.
   ```
   mail
   ```

4. Create an alias grouping the two users.
   ```
   sudo vim /etc/mail/aliases
   sudo newaliases
   ```

5. Which file contains the emails of the second user (user2)?
   ```
   # ls /var/spool/mail
   ecanet    root  test1  test2

   # ls -l /var/spool/mail/test2
   -rw-rw---- 1 test2 mail 627775 Mar  8 13:16 /var/spool/mail/test2

   # head /var/spool/mail/test2

   ```

6. Which command can the root user execute to list the undelivered messages that originated on the local system? (there are two commands that do the same).
   ```
   mailq
   ```

7. Where are held the messages waiting for delivery?
   ```
   /var/spool/mqueue
   ```

8. How can a user automate sending the incoming messages to another addresses?
   ```
   # in the user’s home directory
   .forward 
   owns-user, other, users
   ```
