 10. Set the umask for: user full access, group read and navigate access and others none. Then show it. Check it creating the file newfile1 and the directori newdir1
     ```
     umask 027

     mkdir newdir1
     ls -l

     ```

 12. Change the ownership of the file newfile1 from the current user to another user.

     ls -l newfile1
     ```

 13. Change the ownership of the file newfile2 from teh current user to another user and group.
