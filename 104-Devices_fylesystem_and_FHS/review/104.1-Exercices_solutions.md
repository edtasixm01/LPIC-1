[ Real practice ]

12. Create the partitions layout: sda1, sda5, sda6, sda7
    ```
    sudo fdisk /dev/sda
    n, e, 1, enter, enter
    n, l, 5, enter, +1G
    n, l, 6, enter, +500M
    n, l, 7, enter, enter 
    ```
    
13. Create the partition layout: sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4
    ```
    sudo fdisk /dev/sda
    n, p, 1, enter, +500M
    n, p, 2, enter, +500M
    n, p, 3, enter, +500M
    n, p, 4, enter, enter
    ```
    
14. Assign an ext4 fstype to a partition.
    ```
    sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1
    ```
    
15. Assign an vfat type to a partition.
    ```
    sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sda2
    ```
    
16. Assign an ntfs type to a partition
    ```
    sudo mkfs -t ntfs /dev/sda3
    ```
    
17. Assign an xfs type to a partition.
    ```
    sudo apt-get install xfsprogs
    sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/sda2
    ```

18. Create a swap partition.
    ```
    sudo mkswap /dev/sda3
    ```
    
19. Activate the swap partition.
    ```
    sudo swapon /dev/sda3
    ```

20. Show all swap partitions.
    ```
    sudo swapon -a
    ```
