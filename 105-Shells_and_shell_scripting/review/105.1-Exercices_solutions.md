    echo $class $city

    exit
    ```

11. For all system users, configure the alias **myself** (show the id and whoiam) and the alias **isday** (show the date and uptime).   In another session test it using sudo login user, and show the alias.
    ```

      # at the end
      alias myself='id; whoiam'
      alias isday='date; uptime'
    ```

    alias
    
    myself
    isday
    
    exit
    ```

12. Only for your user, configure the variable **name** with your name and the **city** variable with the value “Girona”.  Start a non login shell with bash and show the variables: class, city and name.

    bash
    
    alias
    myself
    isday
    processes
    ```

      # at the end
      date
      uptime
    ```
    ```
    sudo login pue
    ```

[path]

15. Create the /tmp/bin directory and copy the date command inside calling it **cal**. Copy also the cal command and call it **mycal**.
    ```
    mkdir /tmp/bin
    cd /tmp/bin
    
    cp /usr/bin/date cal
	cp /usr/bin/cal  mycal
    ```
    
16. Executa mycal using an absolute path
    ```
    /tmp/bin/mycal
    ```

17. Execute mycal using a relative path.
    ```
    ./mycal
    ```

18. Configure the PATH to use /tmp/bin with less precedence.
    ```
    OLDPATH=$PATH
    
    PATH=$PATH:/tmp/bin
	```

19. Locate with *which -a* all the **cal** commands. Which has the most precedence?. Execute it.
	```
	which -a cal
	
	# /usr/bin/cal has precedence
	# /bin/cal less
	# /tmp/bin/cal the lesser precedence

	cal
	# execute the system's cal 
	```

20. Configure the PATH to use /tmp/bin with higher precedence. 
    ```
    PATH=/tmp/bin:$OLDPATH
    ```

21. Locate with *which -a* all the **cal** commands. Which has the most precedence?. Execute it.
    ```
    which -a cal
    
    # /tmp/bin/cal
    # /usr/bin/cal
    # /bin/cal
    
    cal
    # execute the 'fake' version of cal that is the command date
    ```
