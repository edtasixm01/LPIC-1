      ```


[paste]

  33.  Create the two next files and paste the contents to a new file.
```
cat <<EOF > file1.txt
IBM
INTC
SAP
VMW
EOF
```
```
cat <<EOF > file2.txt
174.99
22.99
59.37
102.92
EOF
```

  34. Paste the two previous files using the -s option.

  35. Create a file named fit1.txt containing the login, passwd and uid of the then first system users. Create a file named fit2 containing he gid, home and shell of the first then system users. Show the two files pasted.


[join]


  36. Create the files noms.txt and cognoms.txt and join them. Observe the difference.
```
1 pere
3 marta
4 borrell
5 pau
9 rosa
```
```
1 puig
2 vilada
3 mas
5 pou
9 roure
```

  37. Repeat the previous exercise doing a  left join. And then, again doing a full outer join.

  38. Create the file cognoms2.txt and join noms.txt with cognoms2.txt using the id field as key.
```
puig pedro≈õ 1
vilada vendrell 2
mas morell 3
pou prat 5
roure ribalta 9
```

  39. Repeat the previous exercise doing a full outer join.

      *join -a1 -a2  -j1 1 -j2 3 noms.txt cognoms2.txt*
